## Lab Purpose and Components
This lab included basic setup of studentsâ€™ personal computers to prepare them for the class. It also included a basic introduction to using the command terminal.

## What I Learned
Prior to this lab, I was not very familiar with PowerShell, or command line interfaces in general. It was a great introduction to what it can be used for, and how it can help programmers.
